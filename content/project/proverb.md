The feasibility of a multi-phasic exercise-based intervention utilising the Health Action Process Approach and wearable technology in women before and after surgery for breast cancer.

Poor preoperative fitness and physical capacity are risk factors for postoperative complications, delayed recovery, and prolonged disability (McLennan et al., 2019; van Rooijen et al., 2017). Despite limited evidence in women with breast cancer, exercise-based prehabilitation in people with lung cancer, colon, and prostate cancer has shown beneficial effects on physical capacity, function, lung function, urinary continence, postoperative morbidity, quality of life and mood (Boereboom; Faithfull; Singh). In addition, early intervention may improve patient engagement and adherence in postoperative rehabilitation and exercise programmes (Santa-Mina et al., 2017). Therefore, exercise in this postoperative, pre-chemotherapy period may prevent deconditioning and treatment-related morbidity and improve drug tolerance during adjuvant chemotherapy (Santa-Mina et al., 2017; Beaudry et al., 2019). However, there is a dearth of research during both the preoperative and the postoperative to commencing adjuvant therapy phases in patients with breast cancer.
 
A considerable challenge to the feasibility of all prehabilitation trials in cancer populations is the small “window of opportunity” between diagnosis and first treatment. For instance, in their USA-based study, Ligibel et al. (2019) reported a mean intervention duration of 29.3 days (time between enrolment and surgery). This average time is consistent with current targets in the UK, which aim to limit patients waiting time between the decision to treat and the start of treatment to no more than 31 days (NHS, 2019). Given these pre- and postoperative time constraints, participant’s adherence and fidelity to the exercise prescription will be paramount. To facilitate adherence and fidelity we will adopt three strategies: 1) implementation of a partially supervised exercise intervention; 2) utilization of behaviour change theory to support exercise-based prehabilitation adherence; and 3) the addition of wearable technology to facilitate exercise adherence and promote self-monitoring. 

Despite the challenging time-frame to intervene prior to surgery and again before chemotherapy, the promising findings in support of exercise-based prehabilitation in other cancer populations merit an investigation of its feasibility in breast cancer. Therefore, we aim to assess the feasibility of a pre- and postoperative, partially supervised exercise-based intervention, employing wearable technology and HAPA behaviour change counselling, in women diagnosed with breast cancer.
