Poor preoperative fitness and physical capacity are risk factors for postoperative complications, delayed recovery, and prolonged disability (McLennan et al., 2019; van Rooijen et al., 2017). Despite limited evidence in women with breast cancer, exercise-based prehabilitation in people with lung cancer, colon, and prostate cancer has shown beneficial effects on physical capacity, function, lung function, urinary continence, postoperative morbidity, quality of life and mood (Boereboom; Faithfull; Singh). In addition, early intervention may improve patient engagement and adherence in postoperative rehabilitation and exercise programmes (Santa-Mina et al., 2017). Therefore, exercise in this postoperative, pre-chemotherapy period may prevent deconditioning and treatment-related morbidity and improve drug tolerance during adjuvant chemotherapy (Santa-Mina et al., 2017; Beaudry et al., 2019). However, there is a dearth of research during both the preoperative and the postoperative to commencing adjuvant therapy phases in patients with breast cancer.
 
A considerable challenge to the feasibility of all prehabilitation trials in cancer populations is the small “window of opportunity” between diagnosis and first treatment. For instance, in their USA-based study, Ligibel et al. (2019) reported a mean intervention duration of 29.3 days (time between enrolment and surgery). This average time is consistent with current targets in the UK, which aim to limit patients waiting time between the decision to treat and the start of treatment to no more than 31 days (NHS, 2019). Given these pre- and postoperative time constraints, participant’s adherence and fidelity to the exercise prescription will be paramount. To facilitate adherence and fidelity we will adopt three strategies: 1) implementation of a partially supervised exercise intervention; 2) utilization of behaviour change theory to support exercise-based prehabilitation adherence; and 3) the addition of wearable technology to facilitate exercise adherence and promote self-monitoring. 

The supplementation of home-based exercise with supervised exercise sessions has been shown to lead to better adherence rates than just home‐based exercise interventions alone in people with cancer (Turner et al., 2018). Cancer survivors have also expressed interest in walking-based, structured, and supervised interventions that taper into a home-based intervention (Wong, McAuley, & Trinh, 2018). In addition, the safety and the positive impact of the resistance training after breast and axillary surgery has been confirmed in RCTs (Ammitzbøll et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). 

The aim of our chosen behaviour change theory, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), is to facilitate and foster the adoption of and adherence to the target exercise prescription (Schwarzer, 2008, 2016). HAPA aims to overcome the gap between intention and behaviour by distinguishing between 1) “pre-intentional motivations” processes that lead to the formation of an intention to change behaviour, and 2) “post-intentional volition processes” that result in the actual change in behaviour (Schwarzer et al., 2011). According to HAPA, risk perception, outcome expectancy, and self-efficacy are important motivating factors in the formation of an intention to act, but for a person to transform this intention to a behaviour, factors such as planning, action control, social support, and recovery self-efficacy are crucial (Schwarzer et al., 2011).

In this current project, physiotherapists (and physiotherapy assistants) will support patient’s in action planning (the when, where and how of exercise) and coping planning (identifying barriers to exercise and developing strategies to overcome them) across two counselling sessions (one pre-surgery and one post-surgery). Individualised exercise prescription guided by HAPA can instil patients with a sense of control over their health because it targets self-efficacy, planning constructs, and affective attitudes. Furthermore, identifying salient cues relating to the exercise situation (when, where) and sequence of exercise actions (how) will support the recall and behavioural enactment of exercise intentions (Zhang, Zhang, Schwarzer, & Hagger, 2018). Coping planning, will identify and anticipate any difficulties, barriers, or personal risk situations relative to the planned actions, and identify coping strategies intended to overcome these (i.e. If obstacle XY occurs, Then I will do Z). One recent study, providing tentative evidence in support of HAPA-based exercise interventions in cancer populations, found that a greater number of patients with cancer met recommended physical activity guidelines after a HAPA-based intervention compared with a stress management control group (Unger et al., 2016). 

To foster motivation and self-efficacy, and facilitate action planning within the HAPA framework, participants will need to monitor their progress against the targets set and regulate their behaviour accordingly. Wearable devices, such as fitness bands and smart watches, provide a promising tool to allow patients to self-monitor (i.e. observe and record one’s own behaviour) their exercise behaviour, usually in the form of step counts or energy expenditure. These devices can then be paired with a smartphone application or website to give users a summary of their exercise data. The rationale for use of wearable devices, therefore, is that by observing and recording their exercise behaviour, participants are educated and motivated toward the desired levels of exercise (Patel et al., 2015). However, to translate self-monitoring into actual behaviour change it is likely that the addition of behaviour change theory is required (DiFrancisco-Donoghue et al., 2018; Marcu et al., 2018; Coughlin & Stewart, 2016). Although evidence for the use of wearable devices coupled with behaviour change counselling is limited in women breast cancer, encouraging evidence has recently emerged. Lynch and colleagues (2019) demonstrated an increase in accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and decreased sitting time in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors using a combination of mobile health tools, goal-setting, and health coaching. 
Despite the challenging time-frame to intervene prior to surgery and again before chemotherapy, the promising findings in support of exercise-based prehabilitation in other cancer populations merit an investigation of its feasibility in breast cancer. Therefore, we aim to assess the feasibility of a pre- and postoperative, partially supervised exercise-based intervention, employing wearable technology and HAPA behaviour change counselling, in women diagnosed with breast cancer.
