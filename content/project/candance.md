We plan to conduct a 3-arm randomised controlled trial to assess the effects of a 12-week dance intervention versus a 12-week partially supervised physical activity (PA) behaviour change intervention, supported with wearable technology, on quality of life, depressive symptoms, and fitness in inactive older women with breast cancer, compared with a wait-list usual care condition. In addition, a primary outcome of the partially supervised PA intervention will be to assess its impact on accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA).
